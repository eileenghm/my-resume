    <h1>Eileen Guo's Resume</h1>
    
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I'm a recent graduate from Brandeis University with a dual degree in Computer Science and Economics. Following my graduation, 
        I worked at BONC Beijing as a Software Engineer, gaining experience in projects like a backup restore system and lossful compression feature. 
        I have a strong background in data management, software deployment, and team collaboration. I've also been an active contributor to the open 
        source community, implementing fixes and enhancing documentation. 
        Despite a two-year gap due to relocating and starting a family, I'm ready to reenter the workforce.
        I'm currently taking a web developer bootcamp to acquire a robust skill set and further enhance my technical capabilities.
